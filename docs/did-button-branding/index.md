## DID.app as a social login provider

When offering DID.app as one option among several login providers you **should** follow the guidance on this page.
If your authentication process is only handled by DID.app you may use the buttons show here, but are not required to.

You can use either our "D.I.D Logo" or "D Icon" to indicate to your users that they may sign in with DID.app.
Both come in three styles; **default**, **light** and **dark**.

### The D.I.D Logo

<img height="40px" src="/logo.svg" style="padding:0.5em;">
<img height="40px" src="/logo.svg#light" style="background:#00dfc0;padding:0.5em;">
<img height="40px" src="/logo.svg#dark" style="background:#00dfc0;padding:0.5em;">

### The D Icon
