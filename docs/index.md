### Start Inviting Users

DID.app is the fast, easy, and secure way to invite new users to your service, with magic links.
A new user invitation can help onboard a user in a variety of situations, for example:

- Add a colleague to review your documents
- Share a photo with family members
- Invite a new user to start using your service.

All of these use cases can be achieved using DID.app, follow our [guide for sending secure invitations](/docs/invitations).

### Authenticate with Magic Links

Magic invitations are a great way to grow your service,
and can be used next to your existing authentication solution.
However, you do not need any other authentication as users can sign-in using magic links send by DID.app.

To set up authentication follow our step-by-step [integration guide](/docs/step-by-step-integration).
Or follow our [SPA integration guide](/docs/single-page-app-integration) to start authenticating within your Single Page App.

Or try one of our specific platform guides.

- [Express & Node.js](/guides/express-nodejs-openid-connect-integration)
- [Ruby on Rails](/guides/ruby-on-rails-openid-connect-integration)
- [Phoenix & Elixir](/guides/phoenix-elixir-openid-connect-integration)
- [Wordpress](/guides/wordpress-openid-connect-client-plugin-integration/)

<!-- Can't find your platform? The simplest way to integrate with DID is using an OpenID Connect library for your platform.
A list of certified implementations is maintained at [https://openid.net/developers/certified/](https://openid.net/developers/certified/). -->
