Tokens grant the holder of them certain privileges.

There are three different types of token and each needs to be managed carefully.

### Site tokens

A site token identifies your site with DID.
This token is not secret and can be safely used in the front end.

### API tokens

An API token is used to authenticate requests to the DID API.
**This must be stored securely and used only on the server.**

### Authentication tokens

These tokens are generated by a client when they authenticate.
They are single use.
